A converted React project based on your uploaded webAR project, restyled with a luxury heritage theme.

How to run:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

Notes:
- AR preview uses <model-viewer>. Place .glb files in public/models if not already included.
- Any images/models found in your uploaded zip were copied to public/images and public/models.
